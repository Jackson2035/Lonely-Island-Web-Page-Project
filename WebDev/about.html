            <p>The Lonely Island is a trio of artists that make comedy music. The members of the group are Andy
                Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone. This trio have been most successful together in 
                large part due to their friendship and willingness to share the spotlight. While all three 
                members have gone on to have successful careers outside of music, they still remain friends and
                reunite whenever they get a funny idea for a song in their heads. The group is most known for 
                their outlandish concepts for songs such as a boat ride or the PED usage of former MLB superstars.
                Their ideas and success led to the group working and perfoming with many big stars such as Justin
                Timberlake, Nikki Manaj, T-Pain, and many more. Each of the stars they work with are woven into
                a hilarious and catchy tune that never fails to get a laugh and millions of veiws from their 
                loyal fanbase.</p>
                <p>Since their metioric rise to the top of comedy music, the group has ventured into other 
                careers such as acting and directing. Most notably Andy has starred in several movies and has been
                enjoying a run as the lead of the hit TV series Brooklyn Nine-Nine. Akiva has been best known for
                his directing as of late while also making cameos in the movies he directs such as The Watch where
                the whole group had a rather interesting cameo. And Jorma has spent most of his time behind the
                screen as a comedy writer. The group actually made a movie that has some parallels to their real
                life fame and friendship but with the twist of what would have happened had jealousy ever affected
                the group.</p>
